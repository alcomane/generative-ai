> A curated list of modern Generative Artificial Intelligence projects and services, with a focus on applications in the Fashion industry.

Generative Artificial Intelligence is a technology that creates original content such as images, sounds, and texts by using machine learning algorithms that are trained on large amounts of data. Unlike other forms of AI, it is capable of creating unique and previously unseen outputs such as photorealistic images, digital art, music, and writing. These outputs often have their own unique style and can even be hard to distinguish from human-created works. Generative AI has a wide range of applications in fields such as art, entertainment, marketing, academia, computer science, and notably, **fashion design and production**.
